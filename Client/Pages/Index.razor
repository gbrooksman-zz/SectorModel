            <p>
                This site focuses on building one or more investment portfolios (called Models throughout the site) 
				using ETF Sector Funds managed by State Street Global Advisors. This site is in no way affiliated with State Street Global
                Advisors and does not offer investment advice. This site is intended to allow members to construct their
                own sector models as well as compare sector funds in various ways. Stay tuned.
                The ten ETF sector funds that are the focus of this modeling process can be found by clicking the 'ETF List' button above.

            <h4>Developing the Core Model</h4>
            <p>
                The Core Model is made up of four or more of the nine available ETFs.
                The selection of the particular sector and their relative weight in the overall modeling
                is based on historical price movements of all of the ETFs, macroeconomic factors and analysis
                of other factors.
